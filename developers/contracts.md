## Timelock

Timelocks are a smart contract feature that states that some actions will only be performed after a certain period of time rather than immediately.&#x20;

Ref Finance does not use/have a timelock feature. Ref contracts are directly upgraded from the DAO (ref-finance.sputnik-dao.near), thus providing time to users, via the voting period of the associated proposal, to protect their funds in case they identify suspicious activities.

DAO proposals usually take from 48 to 72 hours either to get approved or rejected.
