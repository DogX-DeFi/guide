# GOVERNANCE

## Initial DAO Structure <a id="9a14"></a>

The Ref DAO has two roles: the council and the community board. The current council is made up of four project stewards, and the community board is made up of 20 highly-engaged community members. …

### Council <a id="b1b4"></a>

The council can create proposals and vote on them. If the majority of the council confirms or rejects a proposal, that decision will stand. Initially, only the council can make proposals. This will be changed once the DAO is operating efficiently.

### Community Board <a id="b4c3"></a>

The community board can vote on proposals. If the majority of the community board confirms or rejects a proposal, that decision will stand. In most cases, the council will defer to the community board’s decision, and refrain from voting.

### First Proposal <a id="315d"></a>

The first proposal is whether or not to create a $REF token to support the ecosystem: [https://v2.sputnik.fund/\#/ref-finance.sputnik-dao.near/0](https://v2.sputnik.fund/#/ref-finance.sputnik-dao.near/0)
