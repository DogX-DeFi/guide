# Boosted Farming

Boosted farming can be defined as the ability to get extra rewards by staking LOVE tokens into the Booster zone.

Once staked (your LOVE tokens), you have boosters for all the corresponding farms. Not all farms qualify for the boosted rewards.

{% hint style="info" %}
Obviously, having active boosters DOES NOT mean that you will get the actual boosted rewards. To do so, you need first, to provide liquidity into the corresponding pools, and second, stake your LP tokens into the corresponding farms&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Booster Logic

A booster is a specific seed. For each affected seed, we have:

Where _base_ determines the relative power of booster to the affected seed.

**Example:**&#x20;

Let's assume that booster is a seed which decimal is 18.&#x20;

If _base_=10,&#x20;

Then 100∗10^18 amount of booster\_locking\_power would yield double extra seed power, increasing the farmer’s total seed power by 3x.
