#### **2.Now, there are also 2 types of removing liquidity:**

Remove liquidity **By Share.**

Remove liquidity **By Token.**

Remove liquidity “_By Share_” means you'll receive all types of stablecoins from the pool in a weight proportional to the pool aka balanced proportion.

Remove liquidity “_By Token_” means you can choose the type of stablecoins you’ll receive and choose how many you’ll receive from the pool without the need of the weight to be proportional to the pool aka unbalanced proportion. However, as the protocol encourages balanced token reserves, any user willing to remove their liquidity in different proportions will be charged accordingly.



#### **2.1. To remove liquidity By Share.**

Simply Enter the amount of LP tokens you want to remove liquidity or Choose how many percent you want to remove.

Hit Remove Liquidity.
