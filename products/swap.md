The liquidity provided comes from Liquidity Providers (LPs) who stake their tokens in the associated 'Pools'. In exchange, they get LP (Liquidity Provider) tokens, which can also be staked to earn REF and other tokens in the 'Farms'.

When you trade (swap) on Ref Finance you will pay the pool fee (trading fee), which is broken down as follows:

For traders, the fee is always taken on the amount paid in. The Protocol and Referral fees translate into LP tokens.

{% hint style="info" %}
For regular pools (Swap function), if there is no account to receive the Referral Fee, it goes to all LPs of that pool as a form of increased LP tokens

For stablecoin pools (StableSwap function), if there is no account to receive the Referral Fee, it goes to the Protocol Fee as a form of increased LP tokens
