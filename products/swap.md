# Trading

The Ref Finance AMM DEX is inspired by Uniswap, the best AMM Product on Ethereum, but built on NEAR Protocol to serve both NEAR and non-NEAR Ecosystem users. Each liquidity pool contains a balance of two tokens, following the basic algorithm x \* y = k on every AMM Protocol. Users enjoy instant token swaps without the need for an order book, whereas liquidity providers could supply the liquidity of the two tokens in a pool to earn a fee.\


When you make a token swap (trade) on the exchange you will pay a customizable trading fee (from 0.2% - 0.6%), which is broken down as follows:\


* Basis fee: Chosen by Liquidity Pool Creators, with 3 options is 0.15%, 0.25% and 0.55%
* 0.04% is transferred to Treasury DAO to facilitate future development of the project
* 0.01% counts as a referral fee for swaps, currently earned by every projects building application or building UI on top of Ref Finance.
