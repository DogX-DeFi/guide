# Instant Swap

Users do not need to set up a REF account, the token in the NEAR wallet is directly swapped in the REF and the swapped token is directly returned to the NEAR wallet. This feature not only enables a one-stop swap, but also provides a more convenient interface for programmatic quantitative trading.

#### Step 4 : Return Swap-out token directly to the NEAR wallet

### Swap-out tokens with problematic transactions are returned to the REF account or to the lost and found account

Swap-out tokens with problematic transactions are returned to the REF account or to the lost and found account.

In the case of a lost and found account, the user can initiate a claim to the REF and retrieve it through the DAO process.

### Specify ‘Referral ’for swap

Referral: The account id that helps the user with swap, as specified by the user, is eligible for an intermediary fee. The fee is paid in the corresponding lp-token.

Note: The Referral needs to be registered as a liquidity provider on the corresponding pool, otherwise the intermediary will not receive the intermediary fee even if the instant swap transaction is successful.
