# Instant Swap

Users do not need to set up a REF account, the token in the NEAR wallet is directly swapped in the REF and the swapped token is directly returned to the NEAR wallet. This feature not only enables a one-stop swap, but also provides a more convenient interface for programmatic quantitative trading.
