# NEAR Account

## Account Generation using NEAR Wallet

### **Step 1: Access wallet.near.org to create NEAR Account**

This is your home page. **If you already have a NEAR Account then you can switch to the User Guide part**. But if not then below is the process of how to create a NEAR Wallet Account. Let’s click “Create account”.

### Step 2: Account ID

This is the place where you can choose your own name account, try to make a good one since you can not change that name after you finish. Some rules that you should follow:

{% hint style="info" %}
Your account ID can contain any of the following:

Lowercase characters (a-z)｜Digits (0–9)｜Characters (\_-) can be used as separators
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Your account ID CANNOT contain:

Characters “@” or “.”｜Fewer than 2 characters｜More than 64 characters (including .near)
{% endhint %}

> Remember that **no one can get it if you aren’t allowed to** (you can sell it and buy another name account in a marketplace).After that just agree with all the Terms & Conditions to continue.

### Step 3: Choosing Security Method

This one is important as you need to choose your secured method. Luckily, you can change this after you create an account, but right now you should select the most secure (i.e: Recovery Phrase or Ledger Nano S or X). You can add two other methods after you finish creating an account.

Now just choose the Recovery Phrase.

### Step 4: Backup your Recovery Phrase (Seed Phrase)

Now your screen will present twelve characters and you have to back up this phrase. You can do the following action to backup:

* Write down to several piece of paper and put somewhere else safe.
* Save it into some files on another computer or phone which you only use it for security purpose (remember to clean all the virus before putting the seed phrase into it).

Remember that if you forget your seed phrase, you will lose all the assets in it and can never take it back.

### Step 5: Verify phrase

Make sure you get your seed phrase secure and then you enter one of the random keyword (in this situation is word number 5) to verify that phrase.

Right now, NEAR Team is running a campaign that helps you to create your wallet free (with extra 0.02 NEAR Bonus to your wallet) so that if you are lucky, this step is done and you successfully create a NEAR Account. If not then you can read the following step, which is fund 1 NEAR to your account.

### Step 6: Fund your account

On the screen is the temporary address (don’t save it). Now you can buy NEAR on any Centralized Exchange that supports NEAR Chain (ex: Binance) and send 1 NEAR to this address and your work is done.

But if you accidentally closed the window even though it told you not to do that, you can go back to [wallet.near.org](https://wallet.near.org) and it will have you logged in with that as your address. You will still be able to receive NEAR from that address, it just won’t be a real NEAR Account. If this happens, you won’t be able to upgrade and you will have to start over again with a new account and seed phrase.

That is done, you have successfully created your NEAR Account and the screen should be like this.
