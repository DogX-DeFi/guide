# Transfer ERC-20 Assets using Rainbow Bridge

This comprehensive guide will show you how to use it:

1. **Prepare ERC-20 assets in your Non-custodial Wallet \(Metamask, Coin98…\)**
2. **Using Rainbow Bridge to transfer tokens to NEAR Protocol Blockchain**
3. **Access** [**ethereum.bridgetonear.org**](https://ethereum.bridgetonear.org/)**, connect your NEAR Wallet and MetaMask Wallet**

### **Step 1:**Choose DAI \(or USDT/USDC, whatever you have\)

### **Step 3: Approve the transaction and click “Transfer”, it will cost you a little ETH as a gas fee \(the amount based on your Gas price at that time, usually around 5$ to approve the transfer\)**

### **Step 4：Confirm the transaction, it will take you 15 - 20$ for the gas fee \(by ETH of course\). It will take a little time for all the blocks to be confirmed**
