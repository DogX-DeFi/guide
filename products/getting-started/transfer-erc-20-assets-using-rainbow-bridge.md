# Transfer ERC-20 Assets using Rainbow Bridge

This comprehensive guide will show you how to use it:

1. **Prepare ERC-20 assets in your Non-custodial Wallet (Metamask, Coin98…)**
2. **Using Rainbow Bridge to transfer tokens to NEAR Protocol Blockchain**
3. **Access **[**ethereum.bridgetonear.org**](https://ethereum.bridgetonear.org)**, connect your NEAR Wallet and MetaMask Wallet**

Step 1:Choose DAI (or USDT/USDC, whatever you have)

Step 2: Enter the amount you want to transfer, let say 200 $DAI

Step 3: Approve the transaction and click “Transfer”, it will cost you a little ETH as a gas fee (the amount based on your Gas price at that time, usually around 5$ to approve the transfer)

Step 4：Confirm the transaction, it will take you 15 - 20$ for the gas fee (by ETH of course). It will take a little time for all the blocks to be confirmed
