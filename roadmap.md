# Roadmap

We hope that Ref.finance will be a fully autonomous community project, so it's not a timeline, it's a to-do list, and we'll divide the to-do list by stages. Once the community and voting system improved, the work sequence and subsequent development within the stage will be decided by the community autonomy.

Ref will grow from a single product (an automated market maker) into a first-of-its-kind suite of products running on a synchronous shard.

_Let's build the greatest swap!_

## Highlights

* Permission-less AMM pools for any NEAR's Fungible Tokens.
* Trading across multiple pools in one transaction.
* _1bps_ referral fee on trading to pay the UI.
* **Coming:** _4bps_ exchange fee to split between $REF token holders.
* **Coming v2:** constant weighted product AMM pool type.
* **Coming v3:** combining AMM with an order book via limit orders.
* **Coming v4:** lend / borrow.
* **Coming in the distant future:** internal balances privacy: hide the balance of each user, removing ability to link two trades to the same user.

Ref.Finance is also positioned to innovate and redefine current DeFi experiences. We believe the relationship between projects and users should be more interactive on the DeFi platform beside simple farming and trading. For example, an ad-board is a feature designed and implemented by existing community members from NEAR that fit into the current creator based culture to re-define how the DeFi experience on NEAR should be.

In conclusion, we hope you can see the vast amount of plans we have in store for our community in the following months. We look to achieve more together with all of you!
