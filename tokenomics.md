# TOKENOMICS

## Distribution

_Ref Finance is a community-led project, and we want the distribution to reflect that. We propose that nearly the entire supply \(minimum 65%, as high as 85%\) be distributed directly to participants based on their interactions with the protocol._

## The $REF Token

Since the DAO has recently voted to create a $REF token, we’ve outlined the breakdown and use cases below. Users can find details from that vote on [gov.ref.finance](https://gov.ref.finance/). In total, there will be 100,000,000 $REF tokens in total supply.

## **Airdrops**

Being a community governed project, our airdrops…

## **Fee Management**

Ref takes a fee of 0.05% per swap. Out of that, 0.04% gets allocated to the liquidity providers, with an additional 0.01% used to reward referrals. Being built on NEAR, Ref users will enjoy lightning fast transaction speeds with negligible fees for all Ethereum assets through our Rainbow Bridge!

## **Liquidity Incentives**

With our farming features soon to be deployed, we are allocating a total of 60,000,000 $REF for liquidity incentives. The $REF token will be the primary reward for users who deposit liquidity and utilize their LP tokens in our farms. Initial pairs will be decided by the Ref Team, with the DAO being in charge shortly after of voting on which new pairs should be added to be eligible for incentives. The structure will be broken down over 4 years to ensure a smooth and gradual release of $REF while rewarding initial users:

Year 1: 25%  
Year 2: 18.3%  
Year 3: 11.67%  
Year 4: 5%

## **Treasury**

Another 35,000,000 $REF will be allocated to the treasury, which will be managed by the Ref Finance team. The treasury is further divided into a development fund \(10%\) for upcoming projects who will develop natively on NEAR and launch through Ref. An additional 25% will be allocated towards future community related activities, events and partnerships.

## **Governance**

Currently, the Ref DAO is made up of a council plus a community board. One of the first proposals post the airdrop and Skyward sale will be to add token holders as a third role for governance.

These $REF holders will be able to stake their $REF to vote on proposals, similar to the council and community board. Proposals can be submitted on [gov.ref.finance](https://gov.ref.finance/) and voters will oversee decisions including treasury management, liquidity incentives, and \(eventually\) even protocol upgrades.
